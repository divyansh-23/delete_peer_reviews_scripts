# delete_peer_reviews_scripts
This is a small script I wrote in JS to solve a problem in my account on ELMS Canvas, a learning management system used in my UMD. Due to some technical glitch each student of a 56 students class were wrongly assigned to peer-review the assignment of 51 other students. So to delete the 2856 peer reviews, this script was used.
