# delete_peer_reviews_scripts
This is a small script I wrote in JS to solve a problem in my account on ELMS Canvas, a learning management system used in my UMD. Due to some technical glitch each student of a 56 students class were wrongly assigned to peer-review the assignment of 51 other students. So to delete the 2856 peer reviews, this script was used.
Reason: The Canvas Support panel could not help me to delete those 2856 reviews and asked me to delete each review one by one using the delete button provided for each peer-review. To save my time I developed this script which saved my manual work of many hours.
